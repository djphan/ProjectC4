So this is just some different name ideas (the only reason for this is to move to an inclusive name, not just canada centered):

Working name:
- Candian Collegiate Cybersports Club <- If the name shorthand is actually "c4esports," I think the "sports" part of "cybersports" is rednundant. - Riley

Riley's ideas:
- Competative Cyber Collegiate Coalition (of esports)
- Competative Computer Collegiate Coalition (of esports)
- Colegiate Competatative Cyber Conference (of esports)
- Colegiate Competative Cyber Council (of esports)
- Colegiate Cyber Championship Community (esports)
- Competative Cyber Championship Coalition (of esports)
